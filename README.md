## Data Cleanup & Analysis
Once I have identified my datasets, perform ETL on the data. Make sure to plan and document the following:

* The sources of data that I will extract from.

* The type of transformation needed for this data (cleaning, joining, filtering, aggregating, etc).

* The type of final production database to load the data into (relational or non-relational).

* The final tables or collections that will be used in the production database.

## Submit a final technical report with the above information and steps required to reproduce ETL process

### Project Report describes the following:

* Extract: your original data sources and how the data was formatted (CSV, JSON, MySQL, etc).

* Transform: what data cleaning or transformation was required.

* Load: the final database, tables/collections, and why this was chosen.
